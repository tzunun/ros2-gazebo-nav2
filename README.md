# ros2-humble-gazebo-fortress-nav2
Install ROS2 Gazebo and Nav2 on Ubuntu 22.04 and 20.04

Use this script at your own discretion.  I have not tested it beyond the simple tutorial found here:

in the section Testing Gazebo and ROS2 integration.

I have not tested the script in Ubuntu 20.04 yet, only Ubuntu 22.04.
